    <p>Just like the white winged dove

```

Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
And the days go by, like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby (everything stopped)
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken-hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him, all alone
On the edge of seventeen
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Well, I went today
Maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah yeah, well, the music there
Well, it was hauntingly familiar
Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir
And a melody, and nothing else mattered
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colours
But the sea does not change
So with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Well, then suddenly there was no one
Left standing in the hall, yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
And not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing, "Come away"
(Come away, come away)
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
I said ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to feel you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
(I'm a few years older than you) my love
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song, sounds like she's singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh</p>
